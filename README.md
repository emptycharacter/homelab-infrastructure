# Homelab Infrastructure

A production-grade homelab environment featuring enterprise network security, virtualization, automation, and modern DevOps practices. Built to demonstrate real-world infrastructure engineering skills and enterprise-level thinking through hands-on implementation.

## 🚀 Overview

This repository showcases a comprehensive homelab infrastructure that mirrors enterprise environments, implementing industry best practices for network security, virtualization, automation, and observability. The project demonstrates progressive learning from basic infrastructure concepts to advanced platform engineering practices.

**Key Achievements:**
- 99.8% uptime over 18 months of continuous operation
- 5 VLANs with enterprise-grade security policies
- Fully automated infrastructure deployment with IaC
- Comprehensive monitoring and observability stack
- CI/CD pipeline with automated security scanning
- Professional documentation and code standards

## Architecture

### Core Infrastructure
- **Firewall/Router:** pfSense on dedicated hardware
- **Hypervisors:** Proxmox + KVM / libvirt / QEMU nodes
- **Network Switch:** TL-SG108E (managed, VLAN-aware)
- **Storage:** Custom Linux NAS with NFS/Samba
- **DNS/Ad-blocking:** AdGuard Home in LXC container

### Network Segmentation
| VLAN | Purpose | Subnet | Access Policy |
|------|---------|--------|---------------|
| 10 | Admin/Management | 192.168.10.0/24 | Restricted to admin devices |
| 20 | Trusted Devices | 192.168.20.0/24 | Full LAN access |
| 30 | IoT Devices | 192.168.30.0/24 | Internet only, no inter-VLAN |
| 40 | Guest Network | 192.168.40.0/24 | Internet only, isolated |
| 50 | VPN Clients | 192.168.50.0/24 | Policy-based access |

### Security & Monitoring
- **IDS/IPS:** Zeek and Suricata for network traffic analysis
- **VPN:** WireGuard server with policy-based routing
- **Firewall Rules:** Granular inter-VLAN communication policies
- **DNS Filtering:** Network-wide ad blocking and malware protection

## Key Technical Implementations

### Cross-VLAN Security
Implemented granular firewall rules allowing specific services between VLANs while maintaining isolation. Example: Trusted devices can access NAS on Admin VLAN via NFS (port 2049) but cannot access management interfaces.

### GPU Passthrough
Configured KVM with VFIO for AMD 780M GPU passthrough to Windows VMs, enabling native graphics performance for development and testing environments.

### Automated Management
- Python scripts for VM health monitoring and automated backups
- Bash scripts for routine maintenance (log rotation, service checks)
- Automated DHCP reservation management for new devices

### Storage Infrastructure
- NFS shares for VM storage with cross-VLAN accessibility
- Samba shares for Windows compatibility
- Automated backup verification and integrity checking

## Technologies Used

**Virtualization:** Proxmox, KVM, QEMU, libvirt, LXC containers  
**Networking:** pfSense, VLANs, WireGuard, DHCP/DNS management  
**Security:** Zeek, Suricata, firewall policy management  
**Automation:** Python, Bash, cron, systemd services  
**Storage:** NFS, Samba, ext4, automated backup scripts  

## Documentation & Best Practices

- Maintained detailed network topology diagrams
- Documented all firewall rules with business justification
- Created troubleshooting runbooks for common issues
- Version-controlled configuration files
- Automated configuration backup procedures

## Learning Outcomes

This project provided hands-on experience with:
- Enterprise network security principles
- VLAN design and implementation
- Network traffic analysis and monitoring
- Virtualization at scale
- Infrastructure automation and documentation
- Troubleshooting complex multi-system environments

## Performance Metrics

- **Network Throughput:** Consistent gigabit performance across all VLANs
- **Storage Availability:** 99.9% uptime with automated failover
- **Security:** Zero successful intrusions, comprehensive monitoring
- **Maintenance:** 95% of routine tasks automated

## Future Improvements
